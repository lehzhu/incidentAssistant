    },
    {
      "speaker": "erin",
      "text": "Yeah, I\u2019m getting reports from CS too. Users can\u2019t even load the homepage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "erin",
      "text": "Confirmed. I tried hitting the app \u2014 getting a 502 within a couple seconds."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "erin",
      "text": "Is it just the web tier or is the API tier also affected? What about our analytics product?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "Looks like API is fine but analytics is down as well - let's record that both Web and Analytics are affected on the incident record please under Affected Services"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "Ok all of us are busy but ya lets remember to record both of those services on the incident record."
    },

      "text": "This is a really crazy one, do you guys have any idea whats going on? I'm not sure what to do here."
    },

      "speaker": "frank",
      "text": "How are we only getting paged now? We've been seeing this for 10 minutes. We need a follow up to tune our monitoring and alerting"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "I managed to load it once, but latency is crazy. Like 10+ seconds on login."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "bob",
      "text": "Looks like this is widespread. We should treat this as a SEV-1. Current severity is SEV-2, but we should bump it up. Can someone take care of that?"
    },

    },

      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "Cloudflare status page is all green. Doesn\u2019t look like an edge issue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "Okay, what about traffic volume? Is this just a spike that\u2019s overwhelming us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "Checking that too. But traffic looks fairly typical for this hour."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "dan",
      "text": "So probably not DDoS or flash crowd then."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "frank",
      "text": "It could still be something in the network path \u2014 DNS maybe?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "frank",
      "text": "I ran a couple tests \u2014 DNS resolution is fine from multiple regions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "bob",
      "text": "Alright, so not CDN, not DNS, not traffic. Let\u2019s look deeper in the stack."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "App servers are showing elevated latency, but not pegged."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "alice",
      "text": "Could this be backend-related? Database maybe?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "bob",
      "text": "Hang on, just pulled up DB metrics. postgres database is absolutely pegged right now."
    },

    },

    },

      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "Yeah, and they\u2019re slow. Like 2\u20133 second execution times each."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "bob",
      "text": "Could this be caused by a recent deploy?"
    },

      "speaker": "erin",
      "text": "Pulling up the deploy timeline now."
    },
    {

      "text": "Deploy #341 hit prod about 20 minutes ago. Owned by the auth team."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "alice",
      "text": "Found the PR. It changes how session validation is done \u2014 adds a fallback path."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "erin",
      "text": "That fallback path might be triggering more DB lookups than expected."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "frank",
      "text": "Oh yeah \u2014 looks like it's running a new query on every single page load. "
    },
    {
      "speaker": "bob",
      "text": "Well that explains the saturation. It\u2019s a pretty heavy join too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "erin",
      "text": "That would hit `auth.sessions` for logged-in and logged-out users, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "erin",
      "text": "Exactly. We're doing full reads even on static pages."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "erin",
      "text": "This is likely our root cause then. Should we initiate a rollback?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "I\u2019m in favor. We\u2019ve ruled out the edge and this is a clear regression."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "dan",
      "text": "Okay, found the rollback playbook. It\u2019s in Confluence, but it looks... really outdated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "Yeah, this mentions using the old deploy tool. That was deprecated months ago."

    },

      "text": "Nope \u2014 permission denied. Looks like I don\u2019t have access to trigger this rollback path."

      "speaker": "bob",
      "text": "Who actually knows how to do this? Has anyone done a rollback on the new pipeline?"

    },

      "speaker": "dan",
      "text": "I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re 8 minutes into a SEV-1 and we still haven\u2019t started rollback."
    },

      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "Honestly wild that we don\u2019t have a clear rollback flow documented."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "bob",
      "text": "This has to go into the postmortem. We should flag the rollback playbook for urgent update."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "erin",
      "text": "Totally. Let\u2019s make updating the rollback steps an action item after this."
    },

      "speaker": "frank",
      "text": "Alright, found the SHA and kicking off rollback now."
    },

      "text": "Error rate is down about 40% already."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "carol",

      "speaker": "frank",
      "text": "Calling it \u2014 rollback resolved the issue."

    },

      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "First thing: rollback took way too long to initiate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "erin",
      "text": "Yeah. The runbook was outdated. I had to dig through old threads to figure it out."
    },

      "speaker": "bob",
      "text": "We should update the rollback runbook \u2014 make it front and center in Rootly."

      "text": "Do we even have tests for that fallback session path?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "alice",
      "text": "Not really. It was an edge case and it slipped through."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "dan",
      "text": "We need to add coverage for that. Maybe even some load tests."
    },

      "speaker": "bob",
      "text": "Let\u2019s flag that in the postmortem. Our initial scope was too narrow."
    },

      "speaker": "carol",
      "text": "We originally thought CDN \u2014 that was a red herring. Worth calling out."
    },
